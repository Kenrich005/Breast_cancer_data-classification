# Breast Cancer Prediction using Classification Algorithms
 
### Data Description
Given are several variables to determine if a patient has Malignant or Benign Cancer.
The variables are:
1. Clump Thickness
2. Size Uniformity
3. Shape Uniformity
4. Marginal Adhesion
5. Epithelial Size
6. Bare Nucleoli
7. Bland Chromatin
8. Normal Nucleoli
9. Mitoses

In this R code, we will perform basic data cleaning, EDA and algorithm modelling.

Few things to note:
1. I have activated library next to its respective function in order for you to understand which library does what.
2. Have created a simple function to create a boxplot using a single line instead of multiple lines without it.
3. The Classification Algorithms executed here are:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Naive Bayes
     - Linear Discriminatory Analysis


Lastly, please do leave a :star: if you liked it.
